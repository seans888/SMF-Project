3 View Benefit Deductions
4 For Part time Jobs
	a.) When is he/she available for work
	b.) where do he/she wants to work 
		the location should be suggested by a dropdown list
			ex. Select Region : (dropdown), Select City (dropdown), Select company(dropdown)
5 Regular Reports (I think this will be included in the documents we requested)

6 Nice to have: Scholars could input details regarding their OJT (so SMF could see the standing of the Scholars)
	(I think they could just ask the school regarding this)

	-2 week notice
	if the scholar is late for the requirement
	-every monday alert

Backend
	According to Sir JoeGene
