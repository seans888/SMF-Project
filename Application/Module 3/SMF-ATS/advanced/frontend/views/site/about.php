    <br>The SM College Scholarship program started with the vision of SM patriarch
	<br>Henry Sy, Sr.â€”to send one child from a less fortunate family to college. After 
	<br>graduation and upon employment, the scholar could send one sibling to school 
	<br>and thus help provide a better future for the family.

	<br><br>The SM Scholarship Program has produced over 1,900 graduates to date. 
	<br>Currently, it supports 1,500 scholars in its 82 partner colleges and universities, 
	<br>nationwide.

	<br><br>In 2014, SM Foundation lauded its 18th batch of SM Scholar-graduates which 
	<br>produced 220 graduates, 69 of them receiving honors. SM Foundation also 
	<br>welcomed 326 new scholars into its program for school year 2014-2015, 100 of 
	<br>which are survivors from Haiyan (local name: Yolanda)-stricken areas.

	<br>Scholars are entitled to full matriculation fees and monthly stipend. They are also 
	<br>given a chance to experience summer/Christmas break jobs at SM Malls and, 
	<br>after their graduation, will be offered exclusive job opportunities by the SM Group.</p>
