                <p>The English word "news" developed in the 14th century as a special use of the plural form of "new". In Middle English, the equivalent word 
				was newes, like the French nouvelles and the German neues. Similar developments are found in the Slavic languages—the Czech and Slovak noviny (from nový, "new"), 
				the cognate Polish nowiny and Russian novosti—and in the Celtic languages: the Welsh newyddion (from newydd) and the Cornish nowodhow (from nowydh)</p>
